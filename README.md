# snake-game README
Small java project building on Bro Code's Java Snake Game tutorial. <br>
I've always enjoyed playing snake so I wanted to try creating my own version. 

## Additional Features
![Alt text](/src/images/enemyHead.png)<br>
Added enemy snake (uses greedy algorithm)<br>
![Alt text](/src/images/mouse.png)<br>
Changed apples to mice <br>
You can restart the game after game over by pressing 'space' <br>
You still move using up, down, left, right arrow keys <br>
<br>
There are 2 game modes: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; easy = without enemy snake <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard = with enemy snake <br>
